# 1. Background
## 1.1 Aims and objectives
The aim of this Python project is to use Object-Orientated Programming in mitigating a security issue for an appointment and scheduling management system (ASMIS) of Queens Medical Centre. The ASMIS is a cloud-based software as a service (Saas) and can be access through mobile and desktop devices. The ASMIS contains basic information related to patient’s registration details, appointments and preferred medical specialist as well as the medical clinic’s administrative staff who maintain the availability and scheduling of the medical specialists. Although the patient’s and clinic’s core information and records are isolated from AMSIS, threat actors can obtain user's Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
